Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 
Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

Run on an emulator
-------------------
Run the app on an emulator as follows:

In Android Studio, create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that the emulator can use to install and run your app.
In the toolbar, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu.
From the target device drop-down menu, select the AVD that you want to run your app on.
Click Run.

Android Studio installs the app on the AVD and starts the emulator. You now see "Hello, World!" displayed in the app.
